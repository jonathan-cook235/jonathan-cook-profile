summary: Gave a talk on the findings and results of my participation in the Data Science for Social Good Fellowship.
abstract: 'Today, just over half of all people worldwide use the Internet. Yet in our fast-paced digital world, being offline excludes people from a host of opportunities. The Internet has grown beyond the remit of mere communication service and now grants access to global knowledge, social empowerment and new economic activities. In a word, the Internet fuels social and economic development and thus has been moving higher on national policy agendas around the world, all the more in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, many countries lack data on Internet use in the society and can therefore not tackle the challenges most efficiently. This pioneering project aims at developing mechanisms for predicting the world's offline population, using school locations as the starting point.'
