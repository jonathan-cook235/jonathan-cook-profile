I'm a first-year PhD student on the Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems Centre for Doctoral Training at Oxford University. I share with many others the vision of artificial agents that can coordinate and cooperate to aid humans in solving problems within practical environments, be they digital or physical. This necessitates progress in general-sum settings with only partial, imperfect information available. These are precisely the kinds of settings, resembling real-world scenarios, that I aim to help bring progress in AI research towards.
